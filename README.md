# The-Impostor-Project
Ever played Among Us with your friends and someone wouldn't just stop talking or yell in the middle of the game? Well, here is The-Impostor-Project Bot which mutes everyone and resumes the song played and unmutes everyone and pauses the song on command, so you can kick the non-impostor out for no stupid reason.

### Here are the list of commands that you could use:
```
>play - to play a song (>play rock+roll eden).

>pause - to pause the song.

>skip - to skip the song.

>stop - to stop the song.

>shuffle - to shuffle the songs.

>now - to show which song is playing.

>queue - to show the queued songs.

>game - to mute everyone in the voice channel and play or resume the music played.

>done - to unmute everyone in the voice channel and pause the song played.

>done! - to unmute everyone in the voice channel but not pause the song.

>restart - to restart the bot.

>stfu - to randomly tell someone to shut the f* up.

>whoissimp - to randomly spot a simp.

>whoissus - to randomly tell who is suspicious.

```
